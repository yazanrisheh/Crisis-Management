Typhoon Gaemi - Jul 2024,"On 24 July, the combined effects of the Southwest Monsoon, enhanced by Tropical Cyclone Gaemi(local name: Carina), brought heavy to intense rains across the Philippines. Northern Luzon, particularly the provinces of Cagayan, Isabela, and Ilocos Norte, experienced severe impacts, while Central Luzon provinces Pampanga, Tarlac, and Nueva Ecija faced severe flooding and power outages. In Metro Manila, home to 13.5 million people, heavy rainfall caused urban flooding, road closures, and significant disruptions. By 10am local time, the water level in the Marikina River surpassed 18 meters, triggering mandatory evacuation of numerous families, with water levels reaching over 20.7 meters by 7pm. In one area in Quezon City, it was recorded that 458 mm of rain fell within a 24-hour period. In comparison, during Typhoon Ondoy in September 2009, the recorded rainfall over the same duration was 455 mm. Tropical cyclone Gaemi, which has intensified into a Super Typhoon, is expected to make landfall over northern Taiwan before exitingthe Philippine Area of Responsibility by noon on 25 July. Moderate to intense rainfall is still expected to continue over the western portion of Luzon until 26 July according to the Philippines weather agency PAGASA.

Super Typhoon Gaemi (local name Carina) has been downgraded to a typhoon as it crossed Taiwan and exited the Philippine Area of Responsibility (PAR) on 25 July. The storm, combined with the effects of the southwest monsoon, brought heavy rainfall to the western section of Luzon, including Metro Manila. Flooding incidents have been reported in Metro Manila and nearby provinces. Due to the intense amount of rainfall, floodgates were opened for Ipo and Binga dams located in Central and Northern Luzon respectively, which further contributed to flooding incidents. In addition, La Mesa Dam, located near Metro Manila, reached its spilling level, but has since returned to normal levels. Weather is expected to improve in the coming days, but the state weather bureau PAGASA reports heavy to intense rainfall is expected over the western portion of Luzon until 27 July.

Guatemala: Dengue Outbreak - May 2024,"Dengue continues to be the arbovirus with the highest number of reported cases in the Americas region, with outbreaks occurring on a cyclical basis every 3 to 5 years. During the year 2024 between epidemiological weeks (SE, for its acronym in Spanish) 1 and 16 of 2024, a total of 6,769,140 suspected cases of dengue were reported (cumulative incidence of 717 cases per 100,000 population). This ígure represents an increase of 206% compared with the same period in 2023 and 387% compared with the average for the last 5 years (1).

On 16 February 2024, in view of the exponential increase in dengue cases observed in the írst weeks of the year in several countries of the Region of the Americas, PAHO made an urgent appeal to Member States. The organization emphasized the need to intensify vector control measures and to maintain active surveillance, ensuring early diagnosis and timely treatment of cases (2).

On 7 March 2024, the Ministry of Public Health and Social Assistance (MSPAS, for its acronym in Spanish) of Guatemala, through the Directorate of Epidemiology and Risk Management, issued an epidemiological alert for dengue (3). This alert was established to reinforce dengue control and prevention plans, based on data accumulated up to epidemiological week 7, which ended on 17 February. As of that date, a total of 6,760 cases of dengue fever had been recorded this year, of which 31 were severe cases resulting in 3 deaths. The decision to issue this alert was motivated by the beginning of the high dengue transmission season in the country. As part of this measure, speciíc epidemiological surveillance actions were reinforced, including standardized protocols for the detection, notiícation, and registration of cases in hospitals and health areas.

Botswana: Drought - May 2024,"On May 24, 2024, the Rural Development Secretariat under the Ministry of Local Government and Rural Development issued a report urging support due to the devastating impact of drought on food security drivers, nutrition, water supplies, and food production. The report highlighted a signicant decline in crop yields, with a drop from 206,572 tons harvested in 2021/22 to 125,184 tons in 2022/23. Cereal production in 2022/23 reached only 67,530 tons, which is equivalent to just 23% of the national requirement. The 2022/23 cropping season experienced low and highly erratic rainfall, along with extended dry periods, severely impacting food and agricultural production, disrupting urban water supplies, and damaging the rural economy and socio-cultural structures. As a result, the nation is experiencing signicant chronic food insecurity, with over 10% of the population facing food and nutrition problems.
The country has experienced dry spells and rainfall decits in recent years, leading the government to declare a drought emergency in July 2023. This marks the third consecutive year of severe drought, affecting arable agricultural land in a context where 70% of the rural population depends on agriculture for their livelihoods, primarily through rain-fed farming. Since then, 163,000 people have been categorized as food insecure. The SADC Synthesis Report on The State of Food and Nutrition Security and Vulnerability in Southern Africa indicated that 37,000 individuals in Botswana are experiencing food insecurity in 2024.

Mozambique: Drought - May 2024,"As vast parts of southern Africa grapple with an unprecedented mid-season dry spell, the food security situation in Mozambique continues to deteriorate. The compounded effects of El Niño, above-average temperatures, extreme weather events such as Tropical Storm Filipo, excessive floods, coupled with the lasting impact of past shocks such as Tropical Cyclone Freddy, are exacerbating the situation. The 2023-2024 El Niño has been one of the strongest on record, bringing below-average rainfall between October 2023 and February 2024 in southern and central Mozambique, and average to above-average rainfall to the northern part of the country. This disruption continues to impact agriculture and rural livelihoods. Between November 2023 and February 2024, typically the rainy season in Mozambique, the southern and central regions of the country experienced persistent dryness and unusually high temperatures, and many areas received less than half of their typical rainfall. These events in turn led to deteriorating vegetation conditions and crop wilting in parts of the central provinces. ([IFRC, 27 May 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4065342))

Crisis (IPC Phase 3) outcomes are likely to prevail from June to September 2024 in the El Niño-induced drought and conflict-affected areas of Mozambique due to poor harvests, limited income-earning opportunities, and failure to engage in normal livelihoods activities. In addition to these shocks, above-average food prices will make it difficult for poor and very poor households to access food from the markets. In Cabo Delgado, several areas receiving regular humanitarian food assistance will likely be facing Stressed! (IPC Phase 2!) outcomes. Crisis (IPC Phase 3) outcomes are expected to expand
between October 2024 and January 2025, mainly in the country's central region. The impact of the lean season, which includes the rapid depletion of below-average food stocks for families who were able to harvest some of their own crops, combined with above-average food prices and below average income, will lead to an expansion of areas facing Crisis (IPC Phase 3) outcomes, particularly in areas affected by the El Niño-induced drought.

Grenada: Drought - May 2024,"On May 10, 2024, [...] The Government of Grenada officially declared a water crisis due to an acute shortage of water resources. Effective from May 12, 2024, stringent water usage restrictions were enforced across the island. These measures aim to curb wasteful practices and encourage responsible water management during this critical period. The declaration and ensuing water restrictions was prompted by a combination of prolonged drought conditions, insufficient rainfall, and aging water infrastructure. Collectively, this led to critically low water levels in reservoirs. The government implemented several emergency measures to manage the crisis and mitigate its impacts on the population. The 2024 water crisis in Grenada is noted as the most severe in 14 years. This crisis is marked by unprecedented low water levels, significant water rationing, and stringent restrictions on water usage for non-essential activities. The declaration highlighted the extreme nature of the drought and the urgent need for conservation and improved water management strategies to ensure the availability of safe drinking water for the island's residents. ([IFRC, 24 May 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4064984/))

Although recent rains have slightly alleviated the situation, water supplies remain insufficient. Farmers are struggling with dry conditions, leading to crop failures and food shortages. Meanwhile, a heatwave has worsened conditions, causing bush fires and exacerbating water shortages. In response, the Grenada Red Cross, supported by the IFRC, is working with the National Water and Sewage Authority to assist the affected population. Despite immediate relief efforts, the water crisis is expected to persist until the peak of the next rainy season.

Angola: Polio Outbreak - May 2024,"In the week of May 3rd, 2024, Angolan health authorities announced that polio had been detected in Chitato Municipality, Lunda Norte province, which borders the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). A person infected with 'circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2' (cVDPV2) was confirmed. Although a polio outbreak had already been declared by the government on February 27th, 2024, due to environmental samples found in the provinces of Luanda and Huambo, the case on May 3rd was the first human case reported. The Government of Angola has classified the current outbreak as a Grade 2 emergency (i.e., moderate level – aligned with WHO classification) due to the high risk of virus spread, exacerbated by poor water and sanitation infrastructure and hard-to-reach populations. Additionally, there is an increased risk of cross-border transmission along the DRC-Angola border, with genetic sequencing indicating a link to a polio virus reported in the DRC's Cassai Oriental province, classified as cVDPV2 (Circulating Vaccine-Derived Poliovirus Type 2).

Papua New Guinea: Landslide - May 2024,"A huge landslide occurred in the Enga province, central-northern Papua New Guinea on 23 May, resulting in casualties and widespread damage. According to DG ECHO partners, the total number of casualties remains unverified. Local media reports, as of 24 May, more than 100 fatalities across six villages (where the worst affected is the Kaokalam village) in the Porgera-Paiela district, Enga province due to the landslide occurred on very early morning, local time, of 24 May. Over the next 96 hours, more heavy rainfall with locally very heavy rainfall is forecast over the whole Papua New Guinea. ([ECHO, 24 May 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4064791))

Landslides triggered by heavy rains struck the Tulpar community in Yambali village, Lagaip-Porgera District, Enga Province, Papua New Guinea on 24 May 2024. The area remains extremely dangerous due to ongoing land movement. Access is difficult due to a blocked highway and ongoing instability. As of 26 May 2024, authorities report the death toll has risen to five. Many are missing, and estimates suggest a possible additional 670 fatalities. The authorities of the affected area have declared a State of Emergency and requested national assistance. ([ECHO, 26 May 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4065095))

According to media, as of 27 May, at least 2,000 people are still buried under the debris and more than 7,900 people have been forced to leave the villages near the landslide. In addition, 18 buildings have been destroyed, more than 634 have been potentially damaged, and the main highway has been blocked. ([ECHO, 28 May 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4065627/))

As per DMT report #6 on 28 May, the preliminary estimate of the total affected population is approximately 7,850 individuals or 1,430 households. Further preliminary estimates suggest approximately, 42 per cent are children under 16 years of age. It is believed over 150 structures have been destroyed in the landslide. ([OCHA, 29 May 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4065893/))

The landslide buried one school, and 10 other nearby schools (eight elementary and two primary) were also affected. Health services have been restored in two primary health facilities. The two Care Centers established in Wabag and Mulatika will be developed to host increased displaced populations. Damage to a major road is impeding fuel and food supplies from Wabag to landslide-affected areas. The security situation in the disaster area remains volatile due to competition for resources, pre-existing inter-communal tensions and pervasive gender-based violence; the first serious security incident was reported on 13 June. ([UNICEF, 14 Jun 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4070366/))

Following the landslide in Enga Province in May, the Enga Provincial Disaster Office (EPDO) has been alerted to imminent threats at the Mulitaka Landslide area by emergency response and geotechnical teams on site. Assessments indicate ongoing geo-seismic activity and potential hazards threatening communities within the Mulitaka Landslide Disaster Site and the Disaster Management Emergency Care Center. Bulges, cracks on the road and fault lines on the high ground have been observed, indicating the imminent risk of further landslides. Immediate evacuation and resettlement of the Care Center are recommended. The Enga Provincial Disaster Office (EPDO) issued the new direction to be immediately implemented for the Provincial Disaster Management Committee (PNGDF), Police, and UN agencies to coordinate evacuations, restrict access to the site, and identify new settlement areas. ([OCHA, 26 Jun 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4072993/))

The landslide caused extensive damage to many lives, homes and livelihoods. The extent of the destruction has left an estimated 1,680 individuals displaced, with an estimated 3,979 individuals affected and at risk of displacement. Furthermore; 9,952 individuals are estimated to be directly affected by the landslide. Immediate emergency response and long-term recovery plans are crucial to address the needs of these affected populations and mitigate future risks and vulnerabilities. The landslide has not only devastated the Yambali ward but also caused significant instability in the surrounding area. The soil remains highly unstable, with visible cracks indicating imminent threats to lives and properties. Ongoing geo-seismic activities in the vicinity exacerbate the risk, as the land continues to shift. The landslide covered two creeks with debris and boulders, blocking waterways and increasing the likelihood of further slides. The blockage of these creeks poses a critical risk of flooding, which could trigger additional landslides, endangering the already vulnerable community.

Lesotho: Drought - Apr 2024,"According to the weather update for quarter 1 of 2024 issued by the Lesotho Meteorological Services, the persistent heatwaves and exceptionally high temperatures experienced between January and March 2024 have led to widespread dryness of crops across most fields. The continuous crop failures over the past seasons is exacerbated. The past two quarters have seen the same crop failure leading automatically to the high food prices. There are 41% of rural families spending more than half of their income on food while most of the families leave with low income. In two consecutive agricultural seasons (2021/2022 and 2022/2023), Lesotho experienced harsh climatic induced shocks such as hailstorms, pests and heavy rainfall/waterlogging in most parts of the country. On the other hands, the heavy rainfalls in late December 2023 and early 2024 led to waterlogged fields which resulted in crop failure. The inflation resulting from this crop failures or production failures have a direct incidence to the families already struggling with low income and other factors that make them more vulnerable to food insecurity. Approximately, 325,000 individuals are experiencing the ramifications of the ongoing food insecurity based on IPC information, stemming from the enduring drought that has gripped the nation for years and increased the food insecurity situation. This figure represents approximately 22% of the population. Eight districts on the ten in Lesotho are under Integrated Food Security Phase Classification 3 (IPC3), signifying a crisis state. Berea, Maseru, Mafeteng, Mohale’s Hoek, Quthing, Thaba Tseka, and Leribe areas. In these districts, access to adequate food and nutrition is severely compromised, necessitating urgent intervention and support measures to alleviate the hardship faced by affected communities. ([IFRC, 17 May 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4063043))

A below-normal harvest and increased market reliance have resulted in maize prices rising during the main harvest. Although a larger area was planted in the 2023/24 than the previous season, dry conditions damaged much of the crop between January and March, especially maize. Some poor and very poor households that experienced significant crop losses are already relying on food purchases from local markets, which is earlier than normal. Retail staple food prices are expected to increase further due to below-average local production and higher prices for imported maize. Consequently, household purchasing capacity is expected to decline, particularly between August and September, when market purchases are the main food source, and labor opportunities are often seasonally limited. Overall, most households are likely to continue to meet their food needs through September, driving area-level Stressed (IPC Phase 2) outcomes.

Malawi: Drought - Mar 2024,"About nine million people in Malawi are reeling from the devastating impacts of El Niño-induced floods and drought, which are destroying harvests and causing hunger to soar to crisis levels ... An El Niño-induced drought has severely affected this season’s maize harvest, resulting in a forecast 45 percent decline against the five-year average and exacerbating food insecurity, and about 40 percent of the population could be facing acute hunger by the end of year because of the drought. In addition, about 14,000 people were displaced by floods and landslides in the northern part of the country. On 25 March, the President of Malawi declared a national disaster. The National Response Plan launched in April estimates the needs at US$449 million. Similarly, neighbouring countries of Zambia and Zimbabwe have also declared national drought emergencies. ([CCC, FAO, Gov't of Malawi, OCHA, WFP 13 May 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4061924))

Approximately 4.2 million people (20 percent of the analysed population) are expected to experience high levels of acute food insecurity (IPC Phase 3 or above) in Malawi in the current period (June and September 2024), including 56,000 people in IPC Phase 4 (Emergency) and 4.1 million people in IPC Phase 3 (Crisis). These populations require urgent humanitarian action to reduce their food consumption gaps, protect and restore their livelihoods and prevent high levels of acute malnutrition. An additional 6.7 million people are classified in IPC Phase 2 (Stressed) between the same period and require interventions to mitigate disaster risks and safeguard their livelihoods. Most of the population in Phase 3 or above are not able to produce enough of their own food and are dependent on market purchases for their food needs. The situation is anticipated to deteriorate during the projection period from October 2024 to March 2025 which coincides with the lean season in Malawi. The resulting impact of El Niño on crop production will exacerbate the situation further and is likely to result in an earlier onset of the lean season. In this projected period, 5.7 million people (28 percent of the analysed population are estimated to be in IPC Phase 3 or above). These people will require urgent humanitarian action to reduce food gaps, particularly for the 416,000 people in Phase 4, protect and restore livelihoods and prevent acute malnutrition.
